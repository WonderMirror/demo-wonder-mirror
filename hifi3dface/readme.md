> **Abstract**: *We present a fully automatic system that can produce high-fidelity, photo-realistic 3D digital human heads with a consumer RGB-D selfie camera. The system only needs the user to take a short selfie RGB-D video while rotating his/her head, and can produce a high quality head reconstruction in less than 30 seconds. Our main contribution is a new facial geometry modeling and reflectance synthesis procedure that significantly improves the state-of-the-art. Specifically, given the input video a two-stage frame selection procedure is first employed to select a few high-quality frames for reconstruction. Then a differentiable renderer based 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) fitting algorithm is applied to recover facial geometries from multiview RGB-D data, which takes advantages of a powerful 3DMM basis constructed with extensive data generation and perturbation. Our 3DMM has much larger expressive capacities than conventional 3DMM, allowing us to recover more accurate facial geometry using merely linear basis. For reflectance synthesis, we present a hybrid approach that combines parametric fitting and CNNs to synthesize high-resolution albedo/normal maps with realistic hair/pore/wrinkle details. Results show that our system can produce faithful 3D digital human faces with extremely realistic details. The main code and the newly constructed 3DMM basis is publicly available.*

## Running The Code

### 1. RGBD Face Reconstruction 

To reproduce the results in our paper, please follow the steps provided below.


**1.1 Data acquisition:**

You may use our [RGBD data capture code](https://github.com/lxk121lalala/RGBD_data_capture) (need an iPhone with TrueDepth camera) to capture RGB-D selfies. The color and depth images are in JPG and PNG formats respectively. The resolution of the color image is 1504 x 1128, and the depth image is of size 640 x 480. If you want to use your own capturing system, please modify the code to suit your case. Below are example RGB-D images exported from our capturing app:
<div>
<div align=left><img src="figures/RGBD_data_example.png" alt="RGBD_data_example" width=80%>
</div>

**1.2 Configuration:**

Modify **run_rgbd.sh** as following:

1. Line 6: define the path to **3DMM** as where you download the 3DMM model. 
    ```bash
    basic_path=$(pwd)/3DMM/files/;
    ```
2. Line 7: define the path to **resources** as where you download the data. 
    ```bash
    resources_path=$(pwd)/resources/;
    ```
3. Line 24: define the path to **test data**. If you capture your own data, please specify the path to the video sequence or 4 pairs of (color, depth) images with different poses (mid-left-right-up).
    ```bash
    ROOT_DIR=$(pwd)/test_data/RGBD/test1/;
    ```
4. Line 23: define whether testing data is a video sequence. 
    ```bash
    is_only_four_frame="False" #  True for four frames, False for a video sequence
    ```
5. Line 121-136: configure optimization parameters.
    ```bash
    log_step=10
    learning_rate=0.05
    lr_decay_step=10
    lr_decay_rate=0.9
    photo_weight=100
    gray_photo_weight=80
    reg_shape_weight=0.4
    reg_tex_weight=0.0001
    depth_weight=1000
    id_weight=1.8
    real_86pt_lmk3d_weight=0.01
    lmk_struct_weight=0
    train_step=100
    is_fixed_pose="False"
    is_add_head_mirrow="False" #  True: output symmetrical head completion result
    is_add_head_male="True" #  True: complete head with a male template
    ```

**1.3 Run:**

Please run the follow command to generate the results.
```bash
bash run_opt_rgbd.sh
```

The RGBD data will be used for shape optimization and HD texture/normal maps generation. We highly recommend that you use our 3DMM version **AI-NExT-Shape.mat** in order to achieve the same results as reported in our paper. You can also run our code with **BFM**, but the texture map and normal map will not be generated if you use BFM, as BFM does not provide UV maps.

**1.4 Results:**

The produced results will be saved in the **results** floder in data path, including: 

    - head.obj: the final mesh file
    - albedo.png: the final albedo map file
    - normal.png: the final normal map file
    - test.mtl: a material description file for simple rendering in meshlab

An example of the resulting files is shown below. Note that the our 3DMM version **AI-NExT-Shape.mat** only contains face region, and our code consists of a head completion step.

### 2. RGB Face Reconstruction

Our code also supports RGB inputs without depth data, but **note** that running with only RGB inputs cannot achieve comparable reconstruction accuracy as RGBD inputs.

**2.1 Data acquisition:**
You may use one image or multiple images of the same person to run our code. Please note that all data of the same identity should be placed into the same folder.

**2.2 Configuration:**

Please modify **run_rgb.sh** as the following:

1. Line 6: define the path to **3DMM** as where you download the 3DMM model. 
  ```bash
  basic_path=$(pwd)/3DMM/files/;
  ```
2. Line 7: define the path to **resources**. 
  ```bash
  resources_path=$(pwd)/resources/;
  ```
3. Line 22: define the path to **test data**. You may also specify the path to your own input rgb data folder.
  ```bash
  ROOT_DIR=$(pwd)/test_data/RGB/test1/single_img/;
  ```
4. Line 54-70: configure optimization parameters.
  ```bash
  train_step=120
  log_step=20
  learning_rate=0.05
  lr_decay_step=20
  lr_decay_rate=0.9

  photo_weight=100.0
  gray_photo_weight=80.0
  reg_shape_weight=4.0
  reg_tex_weight=8.0
  id_weight=1.5
  real_86pt_lmk3d_weight=5.0
  real_68pt_lmk2d_weight=5.0
  lmk_struct_weight=0

  num_of_img=1 # The number of input images
  project_type="Pers" # Use "Pers" for selfie photos, and "Orth" for face photos captured in a far distance
  ```

**2.3 Run:**

Please run the follow command to generate the results.
```bash
bash run_opt_rgb.sh
```

Note that if you run the script with more than one images, only the first image would be used for generating the texture map and normal map. Besides, you can also run the code with **BFM**, but the texture map and normal map will not be generated in this case. We highly recommend that you use the our 3DMM version **AI-NExT-Shape-NoAug.mat** for the RGB inputs, as there are no reliable geometric constraints without depth data inputs. 


**2.4 Results:**
 
The produced results will be saved in the **results** floder in data path, including: 

    - head.obj: the final mesh file
    - albedo.png: the final albedo map file
    - normal.png: the final normal map file
    - test.mtl: a material description file for simple rendering in meshlab

An example of the resulting files is shown below. Note that the shape model obtained with **AI-NExT-Shape-NoAug.mat** is already a full head model.

<div align=left><img src="figures/RGB_example.png" alt="RGB_example" width=80%>
</div>

<br>


### 3. Rendering

The produced mesh and albedo/normal map can be used to render a realistic digital human head in a physically based rendering engine like [Unreal Engine 4](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/Showcases/DigitalHumans/index.html) (UE4). The results in our paper are rendered using UE4 engine, with the skin material settings the same as the [digital human rendering showcase "Mike"](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/Showcases/DigitalHumans/index.html) provided by UE4. 

For simpler visualization, we here provide two other rendering ways as follows. 

  - **Rendering with Meshlab**: You can directly use [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/) to open the obj file, with the mtl file in a same folder. Note that normal maps are not used in the rendering. 
  - **Rendering with Three.js**: Please follow the instructions in this repo(https://github.com/cyj907/simple-mesh-visualizer). Normal maps can be used for rendering in this way. 

The rendering results are as follows (eyeballs are attached in the UE4 rendering): 

<div>
<div align=left><img src="figures/render_results.png" alt="render_results" width=80%>
</div>

> Note: The renderings are with different lighting settings. The mesh and albedo/normal map are the same (from RGBD reconstruction) in the renderings.
